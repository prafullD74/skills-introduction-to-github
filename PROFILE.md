Welcome to my GitHub profile!
What is GitHub?: GitHub is a collaboration platform that uses Git for versioning. GitHub is a popular place to share and contribute to open-source software.

What is a repository?: A repository is a project containing files and folders. A repository tracks versions of files and folders.

What is a branch?: A branch is a parallel version of your repository. By default, your repository has one branch named main and it is considered to be the definitive branch. Creating additional branches allows you to copy the main branch of your repository and safely make any changes without disrupting the main project. Many people use branches to work on specific features without affecting any other parts of the project.
Branches allow you to separate your work from the main branch. In other words, everyone's work is safe while you contribute.

What is a profile README?: A profile README is essentially an "About me" section on your GitHub profile where you can share information about yourself with the community on GitHub.com.

What is a commit?: A commit is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project. A commit exists in a branch.

md is a file extension that creates a Markdown file. You can learn more about Markdown by visiting ["Basic writing and formatting syntax"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) in our docs

What is a pull request?: Collaboration happens on a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#pull-request). The pull request shows the changes in your branch to other people and allows people to accept, reject, or suggest additional changes to your branch. In a side by side comparison, this pull request is going to keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the main project branch.

What is a merge?: A [merge](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#merge) adds the changes in your pull request and branch into the main branch
